The two of you\r\nhave cut a swath of infamy across the civilized\r\nworld, and are recognized as the two greatest pirate\r\ncaptains in existence. Now, however, you must\r\ncontest to discover who is the greatest.\r\nBut before you can begin your journey you must\r\ndetermine the strengths and weaknesses of yourself\r\nand your crew. For this you will require two dice\r\nand a pencil to record scores on the Adventure Sheet\r\non pages 18-19. As it is possible that you will not\r\ncomplete your trip in one adventure, you may wish\r\nto make copies of the Adventure Sheet for future\r\nattempts.\r\nRoll one die. Add 6 to the result. Enter this total\r\nunder the CREW STRIKE section of the Adventure\r\nSheet. This value will be used when you engage in\r\nlarge-scale battles using your crew (e.g. when\r\nfighting enemy shipping).\r\nRoll two dice. Add 6 to the result. Enter this total in\r\nthe CREW STRENGTH section of the Adventure Sheet.\r\nThis score represents the manning level on board\r\nthe Banshee and is used to determine how efficiently\r\nyou sail. You will lose points from your CREW\r\nSTRENGTH when you engage in large-scale battles.\r\nCertain actions will allow you to recover lost CREW\r\nSTRENGTH points, but you may never exceed the\r\nInitial score. If your CREW STRENGTH ever reaches\r\nzero, then you and your crew have been wiped out.\r\nYour Abilities\r\nYour ability to fight, withstand damage and escape\r\nfrom tricky situations is determined by your SKILL,\r\nSTAMINA and LUCK. On your Adventure Sheet you\r\nwill see sections where these attributes are to be\r\nrecorded. They are derived as follows:\r\nRoll one die. Add 6 to the result. Enter this total as\r\nyour SKILL score.\r\nRoll two dice. Add 12 to the result. Enter this total\r\nas your STAMINA score. If your STAMINA score\r\never reaches zero, you have been killed.\r\nRoll one die. Add 6 to the result. Enter this total as\r\nyour LUCK score.\r\nUsing Luck\r\nOn occasion, you will be called upon to Test your\r\nLuck. When this occurs, roll two dice. If the result is\r\nequal to or less than your current LUCK score, then you\r\nhave been Lucky. If the result exceeds your current\r\nLUCK score, then you have been Unlucky. Each time\r\nyou Test your Luck, reduce your current LUCK score\r\nby 1 point. Thus, the more you use your LUCK, the\r\nriskier it becomes. LUCK points may sometimes be\r\nrecovered, but you may never exceed your Initial\r\nscore.\r\nIndividual Combat\r\nIndividual combat is conducted the same as in other\r\nFighting Fantasy books. It is used when you, the\r\ncaptain, fight individual creatures. If you are\r\nalready familiar with this system, you can skip this\r\npart of the rules. Otherwise:\r\n1. Combat is simultaneous. Individual combat is\r\nconducted as a series of rounds in which one\r\ncombatant will inflict damage upon the other.\r\n2. Roll two dice. Add your opponent\u0027s SKILL score\r\nto the roll. The total is your opponent\u0027s Attack\r\nStrength.\r\n3. Roll two dice again. Add your SKILL score to the\r\nroll. The total is your Attack Strength.\r\n4. If your opponent\u0027s Attack Strength is higher than\r\nyours, the opponent has inflicted damage on\r\nyou - deduct 2 points from your STAMINA.\r\n5. If your Attack Strength is higher than your\r\nopponent\u0027s, you have inflicted damage on your\r\nopponent - deduct 2 points from your\r\nopponent\u0027s STAMINA.\r\n6. If both Attack Strengths are equal, both attacks\r\nhave missed. Start the next Attack Round from\r\nstep 2 above.\r\n7. Continue this combat until either your or your\r\nopponent\u0027s STAMINA is reduced to zero (death).\r\nLarge-scale Battles\r\nWhenever the book says that your crew must fight,\r\nor when the opponent has STRIKE and STRENGTH\r\nvalues instead of SKILL and STAMINA. then the rules\r\nfor large-scale combats must be used. They are as\r\nfollows:\r\n1. Combat in large-scale battles is simultaneous and\r\nconducted in a very similar manner to individual\r\ncombat. It is a series of rounds in which one force\r\nin the battle will inflict damage upon the other.\r\n2. Roll two dice. Add your opponents\u0027 STRIKE score\r\nto the roll. The total is your opponents\u0027 Attack\r\nStrength.\r\n3. Roll two dice again. Add your CREW STRIKE score\r\nto the roll. The total is your crew\u0027s Attack\r\nStrength.\r\n4. If your opponents\u0027 Attack Strength is higher than\r\nyour crew\u0027s, they have inflicted damage upon\r\nyour crew - deduct 2 points from your CREW\r\nSTRENGTH.\r\n5. If your crew\u0027s Attack Strength is higher than your\r\nopponents\u0027, your crew have inflicted damage\r\nupon your opponents - deduct 2 points from\r\nyour opponents\u0027 STRENGTH.\r\n6. If your crew have inflicted damage upon your\r\nopponent and the option of escaping is given in\r\nthe book, then you may escape. Note, however,\r\nthat this has a penalty: whenever you choose to\r\nescape, you automatically lose 2 points of CREW\r\nSTRENGTH.\r\nare are\r\nunsuccessful. Start the next Attack Round from\r\nstep 2 above.\r\n8. Continue this combat until either your op-\r\nponents\u0027 or your crew\u0027s STRENGTH has been\r\nreduced to zero (unless you escape, of course).\r\nWhichever side is reduced to zero first has lost.\r\nYour Log\r\nYour LOG records how long you have been travel-\r\nling. Using a sheet of paper, you should keep a\r\nrecord of your LOG as instructed in various passages\r\nin the book. You only have a limited amount of time\r\nin which to complete your journey; the LOG will\r\nallow you to see how you are progressing.\r\nRestoring Stamina\r\nIf you become involved in any individual combat,\r\nyou will almost certainly lose some points of\r\nSTAMINA. There is only one way to recover these -\r\nother than the occasional instruction in the book -\r\nand that is by resting. For every day that you add to\r\nyour LOG, you will be able to recover 1 point of\r\nSTAMINA. Note, however, that your STAMINA score\r\ncan never exceed its Initial value. Of course, the\r\nmore time you spend resting, the slower you will\r\ntravel towards your destination - so, beware!\r\nBooty\r\nDuring the course of your adventure, you will\r\nalmost certainly capture some gold and slaves. This\r\nis Booty. There is a section on the Adventure Sheet in\r\nwhich this can be recorded. You start the adventure\r\nwith only 20 Gold Pieces.\r\nThe Map\r\nThe area in which you will be travelling is covered\r\nby the map opposite. It would pay you to become\r\nfamiliar with the names and places on this map, as\r\nthere are quite frequent references to them in the\r\nbook.\r\nTAK\r\nPARINE R.\r\nSCYTHERA\r\nLAGASH\r\nDESERT\r\nENRAKI\r\nCALAH\r\nRIVERS\r\nOF\r\nASSUR\r\nTHE DEAD\r\nINLAND SEA\r\nKIRKUK SEA\r\nMt.

Every\r\nform of vice and illicit activity is not only permitted,\r\nbut even encouraged, in this city of scum. This, your\r\nhome town, is where your adventure begins.\r\nOf the numerous pirates drawn to Tak, you and\r\nAbdul the Butcher are recognized by all as being the\r\nkings in daring and greed. However, neither of you\r\nare particularly wealthy, as your love of gambling\r\nconsumes all the riches that you bring back from\r\nyour journeys against the enemy cities of Lagash,\r\nMarad and Kish.\r\nThe infamy that the two of you have bred is also the\r\nsource of a great rivalry; you each try to outdo the\r\nother in increasingly dangerous but breathtakingly\r\nsuccessful raids. Your goal - the title of King of\r\nPirates, the Sacker of Cities, which is never be-\r\nqueathed, but only earned.\r\nof Tak\u0027s gambling-pits, somebody suggests that\r\nthe two of you should have a contest to determine,\r\nonce and for all, who is the greatest pirate. The idea\r\nappeals instantly to your audacious spirits. \u0027Yes,\u0027\r\nsays Abdul, \u0027let us have a race of speed and\r\ntreasure.\u0027\r\nYou agree upon the terms of the contest. Each will\r\ntake only one ship and, sailing from Tak on an\r\nappointed day, will head for the distant isle of\r\nNippur, which lies deep in the great Southern Sea.\r\nThe journey must be completed within fifty days\r\nand, at the end, whoever has the greatest amount of\r\ngold wins the bet.\r\nWith shaking of hands all round and much toasting,\r\nthe deal is sealed. Your journey is about to begin.",
